# Continuos Integration

We are going to use [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) to [deliver](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-automatically-releasing-with-travisci) this project.

The tools I want to add to the project are:

* __[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)__
* __[commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)__
* __[codecov](https://codecov.io/)__
* __[Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/)__
* __[Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/)__

## [Semantic Release](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-automating-releases-with-semantic-release)

Or the art of letting the machine decide when to release a new version of your application.

## [Commitizen](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-writing-conventional-commits-with-commitizen)

This is a tool to normalize commits. It gives you a simple wizard that allows you to enter a commit message answering a few questions. Then, depending on this commits, semantic release will decide if a new release must be created or not, and the process of updating the changelog, creating the tag, and the new release will be automatize ([see the video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-committing-a-new-feature-with-commitizen));

## Codecov

This is a platform that shows you the test coverage of your project. It only needs the coverage from Jest in the root directory and collect coverage option generates it.

## Greenkeeper

This platform keeps your libraries updated and also test the updates previously passing the application tests, to see if the new versions breaks your app.

## Codacy

Codacy checks your code quality and gives you a mark and a list of improvements to let you know how good is you code and hoe to improve it.
